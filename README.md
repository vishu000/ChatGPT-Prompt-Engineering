* They build chatGPT using LLMs
* Their are two types of LLMs <br/> 
  *   **Base LLM** : The Base Language Model predicts the next word based on a large amount of text training data.<br/>
  *   **Instruction Tuned LLM** : The Instruction Tuned Language Model is fine-tuned with additional context and instructions to improve its performance. It attempts to                   provide more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.
* Base LLMs is trained on a huge amount of text data and further train it & finetune it with inputs & output and further refine using renforcement learning with human feedback.    

#### ChatGPT Principles
* Instructions must be clear enough.
* We have to give sometime to LLM to think.
